CIA - The World Factbook -- HONDURAS

| Introduction | HONDURAS |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras became an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion in damage. Since then, the economy has slowly rebounded. |

| Area: | total: 112,090 sq km |
| | land: 111,890 sq km |
| | water: 200 sq km |
| | country comparison to the world: 103 |
| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than Tennessee |
| Land boundaries: | total: 1,575 km |
| | border countries (3): Guatemala 244 km, El Salvador 391 km, Nicaragua 940 km |
| Coastline: | 823 km (Caribbean Sea 669 km, Gulf of Fonseca 163 km) |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| | continental shelf: natural extension of territory or to 200 nm |
| Climate: | subtropical in lowlands, temperate in mountains |
| Terrain: | mostly mountains in interior, narrow coastal plains |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 684 m |
| | elevation extremes: lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m |
| | highest point: Cerro Las Minas 2,870 m |
| Natural resources: | timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, antimony, coal, fish, hydropower |

| Population - distribution: | most residents live in the mountainous western half of the country; unlike other Central American nations, Honduras is the only one with an urban population that is distributed between two large centers - the capital of Tegucigalpa and the city of San Pedro Sula; the Rio Ulua valley in the north is the only densely populated lowland area |
| Natural hazards: | frequent, but generally mild, earthquakes; extremely susceptible to damaging hurricanes and floods along the Caribbean coast |
| Environment - current issues: | urban population expanding; deforestation results from logging and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes; further land degradation and soil erosion hastened by uncontrolled development and improper land use practices such as farming of marginal lands; mining activities polluting Lago de Yojoa (the country's largest source of fresh water), as well as several rivers and streams, with heavy metals |

| Geography - note: | has only a short Pacific coast but a long Caribbean shoreline, including the virtually uninhabited eastern Mosquito Coast |

| People and Society | HONDURAS |
| --- | --- |
| Population: | 8,893,259 |
| | note: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2016 est.) |
| | country comparison to the world: 94 |
| Nationality: | noun: Honduran(s) |
| | adjective: Honduran |
| Ethnic groups: | mestizo (mixed Amerindian and European) 90%, Amerindian 7%, black 2%, white 1% |
| Languages: | Spanish (official), Amerindian dialects |
| Religions: | Roman Catholic 97%, Protestant 3% |
| Demographic profile: | Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America and has the world's highest murder rate. More than half of the population lives in poverty and per capita income is one of the lowest in the region. Poverty rates are higher among rural and indigenous people and in the south, west, and along the eastern border than in the north and central areas where most of Honduras' industries and infrastructure are concentrated. The increased productivity needed to break Honduras' persistent high poverty rate depends, in part, on further improvements in educational attainment. Although primary-school enrollment is near 100%, educational quality is poor, the drop-out rate and grade repetition remain high, and teacher and school accountability is low. |
| | Honduras' population growth rate has slowed since the 1990s, but it remains high at nearly 2% annually because the birth rate averages approximately three children per woman and more among rural, indigenous, and poor women. Consequently, Honduras' young adult population - ages 15 to 29 - is projected to continue growing rapidly for the next three decades and then stabilize or slowly shrink. Population growth and limited job prospects outside of agriculture will continue to drive emigration. Remittances represent about a fifth of GDP. |

| Economy | HONDURAS |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Honduras, the second poorest country in Central America, suffers from extraordinarily unequal distribution of income, as well as high underemployment. While historically dependent on the export of bananas and coffee, Honduras has diversified its export base to include apparel and automobile wire harnessing. |
| | Honduras’s economy depends heavily on US trade and remittances. The US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foreign direct investment, but physical and political insecurity, as well as crime and perceptions of corruption, may deter potential investors; about 15% of foreign direct investment is from US firms. |
| | The economy registered modest economic growth of 2.6%-4.0% from 2010 to 2015, insufficient to improve living standards for the nearly 65% of the population in poverty. In 2015, Honduras faced rising public debt but its economy has performed better than expected due to low oil prices and improved investor confidence. The IMF continues to monitor the three-year standby arrangement signed in December 2014, aimed at easing Honduras’s poor fiscal position. |
