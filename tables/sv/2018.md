CIA - The World Factbook -- Svalbard

| Introduction | Svalbard |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | The archipelago may have been first discovered by Norse explorers in the 12th century; the islands served as an international whaling base during the 17th and 18th centuries. Norway's sovereignty was internationally recognized by treaty in 1920, and five years later it officially took over the territory. In the 20th century coal mining started and today a Norwegian and a Russian company are still functioning. Travel between the settlements is accomplished with snowmobiles, aircraft, and boats. |

| Geography | Svalbard |
| --- | --- |
| Location: | Northern Europe, islands between the Arctic Ocean, Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Norwegian Sea, north of Norway |
| Geographic coordinates: | 78 00 N, 20 00 E |
| Map references: | Arctic Region |
| Area: | total: 62,045 sq km |
| | land: 62,045 sq km |
| | water: 0 sq km |
| | note: includes Spitsbergen and Bjornoya (Bear Island) |
| | country comparison to the world: 126 |
| Area - comparative: | slightly smaller than West Virginia |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 3,587 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| | continental shelf: extends to depth of exploitation |
| | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | arctic, tempered by warm North Atlantic Current; cool summers, cold winters; North Atlantic Current flows along west and north coasts of Spitsbergen, keeping water open and navigable most of the year |
| Terrain: | rugged mountains; much of the upland areas are ice covered; west coast clear of ice about half the year; fjords along west and north coasts |
| Elevation: | 0 m lowest point: Arctic Ocean |
| | 1717 highest point: Newtontoppen |
| Natural resources: | coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, phosphate, wildlife, fish |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 0% (2011 est.) |
| | arable land: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 0% (2011 est.) |
| | forest: 0% (2011 est.) |
| | other: 100% (2011 est.) |
| Population distribution: | the small population is primarily concentrated on the island of Spitsbergen in a handful of settlements on the south side of the Isfjorden, with Longyearbyen being the largest |
| Natural hazards: | ice floes often block the entrance to Bellsund (a transit point for coal export) on the west coast and occasionally make parts of the northeastern coast inaccessible to maritime traffic |
| Environment - current issues: | ice floes are a maritime hazard; past exploitation of mammal species (whale, seal, walrus, and polar bear) severely depleted the populations, but a gradual recovery seems to be occurring |
| Geography - note: | northernmost part of the Kingdom of Norway; consists of nine main islands; glaciers and snowfields cover 60% of the total area; Spitsbergen Island is the site of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a seed repository established by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Norwegian Government |

| Economy | Svalbard |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Coal mining, tourism, and international research are Svalbard's major industries. Coal mining has historically been the dominant economic activity, and the Spitzbergen Treaty of 9 February 1920 gives the 45 countries that so far have ratified the treaty equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies still engaging in this are Norwegian and Russian. Low coal prices have forced the Norwegian coal company, Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, to close one of its two mines and to considerably reduce the activity of the other. Since the 1990s, the tourism and hospitality industry has grown rapidly, and Svalbard now receives 60,000 visitors annually. |
| | The settlements on Svalbard were established as company towns, and at their height in the 1950s, the Norwegian state-owned coal company supported nearly 1,000 jobs. Today, only about 300 people work in the mining industry. |
| | Goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and vehicles, normally highly taxed on mainland Norway, are considerably cheaper in Svalbard in an effort by the Norwegian Government to entice more people to live on the Arctic archipelago. By law, Norway collects only enough taxes to pay for the needs of the local government; none of tax proceeds go to the central government. |
