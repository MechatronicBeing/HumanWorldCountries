CIA - The World Factbook -- CAYMAN ISLANDS

| Introduction | CAYMAN ISLANDS |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | The Cayman Islands were colonized from Jamaica by the British during the 18th and 19th centuries and were administered by Jamaica after 1863. In 1959, the islands became a territory within the Federation of the West Indies. When the Federation dissolved in 1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency. The territory has transformed itself into a significant offshore financial center. |
