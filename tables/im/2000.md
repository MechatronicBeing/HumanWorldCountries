| Economy |   |

| Economy - overview: | Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income industries.

Trade is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU markets. |
