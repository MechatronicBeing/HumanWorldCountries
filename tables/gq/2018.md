| Economy | Guam |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | US national defense spending is the main driver of Guamâ€™s economy, followed closely by tourism and other services. Guam serves as a forward US base for the Western Pacific and is home to thousands of American military personnel. Total federal spending (defense and non-defense) amounted to $1.988 billion in 2016, or 34.2 of Guamâ€™s GDP. Of that total, federal grants and cover-over payments amounted to $3444.1 million in 2016, or 35.8% of Guamâ€™s total revenues for the fiscal year. In 2016, Guamâ€™s economy grew 0.3%. Despite slow growth, Guamâ€™s economy has been stable over the last decade. National defense spending cushions the islandâ€™s economy against fluctuations in tourism. Service exports, mainly spending by foreign tourists in Guam, amounted to over $1 billion for the first time in 2016, or 17.8% of GDP. |
