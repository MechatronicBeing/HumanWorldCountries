CIA -- The World Factbook 2000 -- Turks and Caicos Islands

  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------

| Introduction |   |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | The islands were under Jamaican jurisdiction until 1962, when they assumed the status of a crown colony. The governor of The Bahamas oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands are presently a British overseas territory. |
