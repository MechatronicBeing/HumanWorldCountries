| Introduction | San Marino |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | The third smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See and Monaco), San Marino also claims to be the world's oldest republic. According to tradition, it was founded by a Christian stonemason named Marinus in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is aligned with that of the European Union, although it is not a member; social and political trends in the republic track closely with those of its larger neighbor, Italy. |

| Economy | San Marino |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | San Marino's economy relies heavily on its banking industry and on the manufacture and export of ceramics, clothing, fabrics, furniture, paints, spirits, tiles, and wine. The manufacturing and financial sectors account for more than half of San Marino's GDP. The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy, which supplies much of the food San Marino consumes. The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. The income tax rate is also very low, about one-third the average EU level. San Marino does not issue public debt securities, and when necessary, finances its deficits by drawing down deposits at its central bank. San Marino's economy encounted setbacks in recent years as a result of weak demand from Italy - which accounts for 90% of its export market - and financial sector consolidation. Italy's implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy worth more than $4.5 billion. These outflows have contributed to a consolidation in the financial sector. Bank difficulties, combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino's largest financial institution and with the recent global economic downturn, have led to a deep recession, a growing budget deficit, and a higher level of debt. The government has adopted measures to counter the economic downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. San Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU members and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully adopt global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. San Marino's government continues to work with Italy to ratify a financial information exchange agreement, seen by businesses and investors as crucial to strengthening the economic relationship between the two countries. |
