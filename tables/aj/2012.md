| Introduction | Azerbaijan |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | Azerbaijan - a nation with a majority-Turkic and majority-shia Muslim population - was briefly independent (from 1918 to 1920) following the collapse of the Russian Empire; it was subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union for seven decades. Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region that Moscow recognized as part of Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s after Armenia and Azerbaijan disputed the status of the territory. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding provinces in the territory of Azerbaijan. Corruption in the country is ubiquitous, and the government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a 2009 referendum, has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the poverty rate has been reduced in recent years due to revenue from oil production, the promise of widespread wealth resulting from the continued development of Azerbaijan's energy sector remains largely unfulfilled. In January 2011, Azerbaijan assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2012-13 term. |

| Economy | Azerbaijan |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Azerbaijan's high economic growth during 2006-08 was attributable to large and growing oil exports, but some non-export sectors also featured double-digit growth, including construction, banking, and real estate, although most of this increase was tied to growth in the hydrocarbon sector. In 2011, economic growth slowed to 0.1%, largely because oil production reached a plateau. Real GDP growth improved in 2012, reaching about 40%, but the current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain volatile, highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and lackluster attempts to diversify its economy. Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. Natural gas from fields under development in Azerbaijan by an international consortium is the only gas currently available for the geopolitically important Southern Corridor project, which aims to improve European energy security. However, Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress, including the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects depend on world oil prices, the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, Azerbaijan's ability to negotiate export routes for its growing gas production, and its ability to manage its energy wealth to promote growth and spur employment in non-energy sectors of the economy. |
