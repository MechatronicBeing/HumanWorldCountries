CIA -- The World Factbook 2000 -- Tuvalu

| Introduction |   |
| --- | --- |
| Background: | In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000, Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv" for $50 million in royalties over the next dozen years. |

| Geography |   |
| --- | --- |
| Location: | Oceania, island group consisting of nine coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Australia |
| Geographic coordinates: | 8 00 S, 178 00 E |
| Map references: | Oceania |
| Area: | total: 26 sq km |

|  | water: 0 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | 0.1 times the size of Washington, DC |

| Coastline: | 24 km |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
|  | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
|  | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Climate: | tropical; moderated by easterly trade winds (March to November); westerly gales and heavy rain (November to March) |
| Terrain: | very low-lying and narrow coral atolls |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m |
|  | highest point: unnamed location 5 m |
| Natural resources: | fish |
| Land use: | arable land: 0% |
|  | permanent crops: 0% |

| Irrigated land: | NA sq km |
| Natural hazards: | severe tropical storms are usually rare, but, in 1997, there were three cyclones; low-level of islands make them very sensitive to sea-level rise |
| Environment - current issues: | since there are no streams or rivers and groundwater is not potable, most water needs must be met by catchment systems with storage facilities (the Japanese Government has built one desalination plant and plans to build one other); beachhead erosion because of the use of sand for building materials; excessive clearance of forest undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the spread of the Crown of Thorns starfish; Tuvalu is very concerned about global increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising sea levels, which threaten the country's underground water table |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution |

| Economy |   |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. Government revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker remittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate mining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however, as phosphate resources decline. Substantial income is received annually from an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals, this Fund has grown from an initial $17 million to over $35 million in 1999. The US government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu, with 1999 payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries at about $9 million, a total which is expected to rise annually. In an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the government is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%. In 1998, Tuvalu began deriving revenue from use of its area code for "900" lines and from the sale of its ".tv" Internet domain name. Royalites from these new technology sources could raise GDP three or more times over the next decade. Low-lying Tuvalu is particularly vulnerable to any rise in the sea level from future global warming. |
