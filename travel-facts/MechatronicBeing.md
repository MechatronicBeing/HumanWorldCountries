- **Last update** : June 23, 2023 (online version, contains useful information, like : Tourist Destinations, Traditional Cuisine and Souvenirs)
- Modifications :
  - used pandoc for converting the online pages to plain text.
  - Moved the information into 2 groups : the Travel advisories (Precautions, Passport/Visa Requirements, Vaccinations and US Embassy/Consulate) and the Country information, and set in tables for easy viewing.
  - the "LGBTQIA+ Travelers" section is REMOVED, because it contains the SAME basic comment for ALL countries, so it's not very helpful as it is. Here the text :
    > Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+) travelers can face unique challenges when traveling abroad. Laws and attitudes in some countries may affect safety and ease of travel. Legal protections vary from country to country. Many countries do not legally recognize same-sex marriage. Approximately seventy countries consider consensual same-sex sexual relations a crime, sometimes carrying severe punishment. <https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html>
