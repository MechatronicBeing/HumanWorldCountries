| Passport/Visa Requirements | US citizens should make sure their passport will not expire for at least 6 months after they enter the country even if they do not intend to stay that long. They should also make sure they have at least 1 blank page in their passport for each entry stamp/visa that will be required. A visa is required. US citizens will need to get in touch with the country's embassy or nearest consulate to obtain a visa prior to visiting the country. If travel originates from a country without an Embassy of Tajikistan, it is possible for a traveler to purchase a visa upon arrival at the airport; however, the traveler will need to first apply for a visa online with the Tajikistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), receive a pre-approval confirmation, and a Letter of Invitation from the US Embassy Dushanbe prior to arrival. |
| Vaccinations | See WHO recommendations. On 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Asia; Tajikistan is currently considered a high risk to travelers for polio; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine.  <http://www.who.int/> |
